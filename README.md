# NLP

First a book is selected then the book is tokenized and stop words are removed, then frequency distribution of Token is displayed. A word cloud is created which is followed by PoS tagging. 

Then the largest chapter is selected from the book and a bi-gram probability table is generated and then a random chapter is selected and based on the table the Shannon Game (fill-in-the-blanks) is played.

The second part identifies all the entities and then the entity types. 

Then TF-IDF vectors are generated for all the chapters separately and check which chapters are more similar by using similarity measures.
